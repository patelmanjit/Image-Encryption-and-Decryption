Web-app is a software platform and operating system those run on a browser. This is a
project that is used to perform secret data transmission by performing encryption of text
on images. The sender uses a key to perform encryption and the same key is given to the
receiver to decrypt an obtain the data.
â€¢ Securing digital images is paramount in today's data-driven world. Image encryption
techniques play a pivotal role in safeguarding visual data from unauthorized access and
tampering. These techniques employ various methods such as encryption algorithms,
steganography, and visual cryptography to transform images into unreadable forms. This
presentation will delve into the diverse methods and strategies used in image encryption,
exploring their significance, applications, and challenges in ensuring the confidentiality
and integrity of visual data.
